### Tech Lead & Developer — Sri Vasavi Digital Service

I work as a **Tech Lead & Developer** under  
**Sri Vasavi Digital Service**  
https://sri-vasavi-digital-service.vercel.app/

My role spans **full-stack engineering, applied AI logic, and technical mentorship**, delivering systems that are structured, documented, and built for real use — not demos.

## Role & Responsibilities

As a lead developer, I am responsible for:

- Designing and delivering **full-stack web solutions** end-to-end  
- Translating business and academic requirements into **production-ready systems**
- Implementing **AI / data logic** where it adds real value  
- Reviewing architecture, code quality, and deployment readiness  
- Mentoring students and junior developers on **core CS and engineering discipline**

This account reflects **work delivered under real constraints**, timelines, and expectations.

## How I Work

- Clear scope and ownership  
- Documentation as part of delivery  
- No exaggerated claims or shortcuts  
- Systems designed to be understood and maintained  

I prioritize **clarity over noise** and **proof over promises**.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Large, structured personal and client-oriented projects  
- Academic and mentoring repositories built professionally

Each repository is organized so others can:

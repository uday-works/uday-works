Tech Lead & Software Engineer
at [Sri Vasavi Digital Service](https://sri-vasavi-digital-service.vercel.app/)

I work at the intersection of **systems, data, and software engineering**.

My focus is on building **production-ready applications** with clear structure, disciplined scope, and long-term maintainability — not demos or short-lived prototypes.

### What I work on
- Full-stack web applications (React, Angular, Spring Boot, .NET)
- System-aware frontend engineering aligned with backend APIs and data contracts
- Applied AI and data logic integrated into real products
- Technical guidance and mentoring across core Computer Science subjects

### How I work
- Clear scope, clear ownership, predictable delivery  
- Proof through shipped systems, not claims  
- Engineering decisions documented and traceable  

### Work
Pinned repositories below represent **real engineering work**, system thinking, and production discipline.

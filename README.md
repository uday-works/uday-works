# UDAY Here!

**Tech Lead & Software Engineer**
at [Sri Vasavi Digital Service](https://sri-vasavi-digital-service.vercel.app/)

I take on **selective client work** and provide **technical mentoring** through Sri Vasavi Digital Service for individuals and teams who care about building things the right way.

My work focuses on **production-ready systems** — where frontend, backend, and data are treated as a single, coherent system designed for real-world usage, not demos or short-lived prototypes.

As a mentor, I help engineers strengthen **core Computer Science fundamentals**, system thinking, and decision-making that holds up in real projects, interviews, and long-term careers.

I work best with people who value **clarity, ownership, and engineering discipline** over shortcuts.
